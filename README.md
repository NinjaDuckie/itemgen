Creating an HTML implementation of the [Star Wars 5e](https://www.sw5e.com) Enhanced Items database in a form that can easily generate new / random selections of chassis, modification slots, etc.

Plans, in order of complexity:

- Import existing Enhanced Item database
- Develop completely random Enhanced Item generator
 - focus on lightweapons to start with
 - progress to vibroweapons
 - progress to armour, droids, cybernetics, starships
- Dropdown selections to determine randomness granularity
- Tiered randomness based on available enhancement selections
